    description: Wind speed component in the x-direction (east-west)
    unit: meters per second

  - name: v_m_s
    description: Wind speed component in the y-direction (north-south)
    unit: meters per second

  - name: w_m_s
    description: Wind speed component in the z-direction (vertical)
    unit: meters per second

  - name: 2dSpeed_m_s
    description: Horizontal wind speed (2D vector magnitude of u and v)
    unit: meters per second

    description: Total wind speed (3D vector magnitude of u, v, and w)
    unit: meters per second

  - name: Azimuth_deg
    description: Wind direction in the horizontal plane
    unit: degrees
    range: 0 to 360

  - name: Elev_deg
    description: Elevation angle of the wind vector
    unit: degrees
    range: -90 to 90

  - name: Press_Pa
    description: Atmospheric pressure
    unit: Pascals

  - name: Temp_C
    description: Air temperature
    unit: degrees Celsius

  - name: Error
    description: Error value from the Anemometer
    unit: meters per second
    notes:
      - "Non-zero values indicate unreliable data for that row"
      - "Corresponds to the u_m_s value when an error occurs"

notes:
  - "Wind components (u, v, w) follow meteorological convention: positive u is eastward wind, positive v is northward wind, positive w is upward wind"
  - "Azimuth_deg is measured clockwise from north"
